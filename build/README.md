## Build Commands

- All build commands for this application go through `npm` and are defined in `/package.json` under the `"scripts"` property.
- Execute each one of these scripts with `npm run scriptName`.
- When you see `npm-run-all`, that executes multiple other targets defined
- With the exception of `node`, the executables used here do **not** need to be installed on the running system, as npm will look under the `/node_modules/.bin` folder
- If a script is called `scriptName`, npm will automatically call `prescriptName` before its invocation and `postscriptName` after.
- Make sure to run `npm install` before attempting anything (only once, unless modules are upgraded in the `package.json`)

### Building for Production

#### `npm run build`

- Build the final product in the ./dist directory. To deploy, just move the contents of ./dist to a deployed directory.

#### `npm run distserver`

- Serve the contents of ./dist to `localhost:3000`. 

#### `npm run start`

- Compile and start serving for development. This also serves the content to `localhost:3000` but will re-compile with any changes, so all you need to do is refresh the browser.

#### `npm run open:src`

- If the server failed to load when running `npm run start`, start it manually with this command.
